# Changelog

ClearCutt Factory is pre-1.0; see [docs/stability.md](docs/stability.md) for
what may change between releases.

## Unreleased

**Signatures from the reusable workflows verify in other repositories
([#11](https://github.com/northcutted/clearcutt-factory/issues/11)).** The
reusable workflows sign with their own identity, so the identity `init`
wrote never matched: in a calling repository, `verify --image` failed in the
reproduce and fleet jobs, and unchanged images were republished on every run.
A signer can now bind signatures to the repository whose run made them
(`sourceRepository`, or `sourceMatchesImage` with `sourceRepositoryOwner`, and
`sourceRef`), checked by cosign, and accept an exact `certificateIdentity`.
`init` writes the reusable workflows' identity bound to the repository.
Existing org profiles: replace `certificateIdentityRegexp` in `signing.verify`
as `docs/adopting.md` shows.

**A stack signer of its own
([#12](https://github.com/northcutted/clearcutt-factory/issues/12)).**
`signing.stacks` is who may sign registry stacks for
`policy.requireSignedStacks`; it defaults to `signing.verify`.

**One trust policy shared with clearcutt-verify.** `signing.trustPolicy` names
a `clearcutt.dev/v1` `TrustPolicy` file whose signers (with roles `image` and
`stack`) replace `verify` and `stacks`; clearcutt-verify reads the same file.

`verify --image` takes `--certificate-identity` and
`--certificate-github-workflow-repository`.

## v0.1.0

The first release of ClearCutt Factory, the build side of
[ClearCutt](https://github.com/northcutted/clearcutt).

**Images.** `lock`, `render`, `build`, and `verify` turn a YAML manifest into
an image that rebuilds bit for bit. Every input is pinned: base and builder
images by digest; apk, apt, and dnf packages (dependencies included) by
version and file hash; release downloads, Go modules, and Nix store paths.
Builds run on a pinned BuildKit, are smoke-tested on every platform, scanned,
gated, and on push signed keylessly with SBOM, vulnerability, and recipe
attestations. `verify --image` rebuilds an image from its signed recipe.

**Apps on stacks.** A stack names the build image, steps, and run image; an
app adds its source. Stacks can be published to a registry with `stack push`
and named by reference from any repository; locks pin them by digest, and
`policy.requireSignedStacks` accepts only signed ones.

**Rebase.** `rebase` moves an image's own layers onto a newer build of its
base after checking that is safe, records the rebase so anyone can repeat it,
and with `-f app.yaml --update-lock` keeps the app's lock on the same base.

**Fleet maintenance.** Reusable workflows build and publish
(`images.yml`), open weekly lock-update pull requests (`update-locks.yml`),
and keep apps on the newest run image (`fleet.yml`). Unchanged images aren't
republished, and an update that resolves the same content proposes nothing.

**Adopting it.** `init` scaffolds an org profile, an example image, and a
workflow. The action (`uses: northcutted/clearcutt-factory@v0.1.0`) installs a
signature-verified binary with cosign, syft, and grype. JSON Schemas for
manifests, stacks, and the org profile are in `schemas/`.
